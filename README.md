# 🌐SARAL – Smart AI for Response, Allocation & Logistics 

SARAL-India is a **web-based prototype** that creates a **real-time digital twin of disaster-prone areas in India**.  
It combines **AI,IOT and Drones** to help authorities and citizens **predict, monitor, and respond to disasters faster**.

## 🚨 Key Features  

- **AI Predictions** → Forecast floods, cyclones, and landslides.  
- **Dynamic Evacuation Routes** → Safe routes that auto-update if roads are blocked.  
- **Emergency Classification** → AI ranks issues as *Critical, Moderate, Minor*.  
  - Example: *Hospital without power = Critical*, *Water clogging in a street = Minor*.  
- **Responder Prioritization** → Guides emergency teams to the most critical zones first.  
- **Authority Dashboard** → Shows danger zones, safe zones, and resource allocation needs.  
- **Citizen App/SMS Integration** → People can report issues with location & photos.  
- **Post-Disaster Support** → Maps damages, tracks relief distribution & recovery.
